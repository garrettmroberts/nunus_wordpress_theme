          <p>How I got started</p>

          <p>What can I say???????  Growing up in a home where love was shown by cooking good soul food which included desserts, I did not have a choice in this venture.  LOL</p>

          <p>My mother and father both from Arkansas instilled the love for GOD and family in me FIRST.   That love sprouted the desire in me to share  my passion of desserts with the world.</p>

          <p>In 2008 my soon-to-be-husband Derek Holloway after tasting a slice of my sweet potato pie said "You should open a dessert business and call it NUNU'S DESSERTS and share your desserts with the world."</p>

          <p>2013 NUNU'S DESSERTS was born!!!</p>

          <p>Thank you to my Creator Almighty GOD, my Ancestors which include my Daddy Jimmie Glover & Momma Gladys Koontz-Glover.  My husband and my children daughters Ebonee Harden,</p>

          <p>Essence Harden-Terry and son Darrell B-L Owens for the support they've given me to fulfill the desire I've always had to create</p>

          <p>soul-made Southern-style desserts for EVERYONE; just like auntie.</p>

          <p>TEA CAKES ANYONE????????</p>
